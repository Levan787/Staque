# Staque

This assigment purpose is to create a data structure called “Staque” which can store only integers. 
Storing even numbers in staque, it will be pushed in front of staque and storing odd numbers. We only delete number from the front or back in staque. 
I created node class, main.cpp, staque.cpp and staque.h.
